In order to see all of the flowers, you have to put the turtle application in full screen.

## Steps/Requirements:
1. Type the number of flowers (only a whole integer)
2. Type in your desired flower type ("Daisy," "Marigold," "Lily," "Rose," "Tulip")
3. Enter the number of petals you want (as a whole integer)
## ALL OF THESE MUST BE TRUE FOR THE PROGRAM TO RUN!!!
However, you can put whatever you want in the code; these 3 requirements must be somewhere in the prompt. Commas are okay, but the prompt has to contain the number of petals and type of power along with the number of flower

### How the terminal should look
